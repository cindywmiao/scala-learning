//An n-bit Gray code is a sequence of n-bit strings constructed according to certain rules. For example,
//n = 1: C(1) = ("0", "1").
//n = 2: C(2) = ("00", "01", "11", "10").
//n = 3: C(3) = ("000", "001", "011", "010", "110", "111", "101", "100").
//Find out the construction rules and write a function to generate Gray codes.
//
//scala> gray(3)
//res0 List[String] = List(000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100)
//See if you can use memoization to make the function more efficient.
